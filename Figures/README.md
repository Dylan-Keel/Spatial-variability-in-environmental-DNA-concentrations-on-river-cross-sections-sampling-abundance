Figure 1: A) Klamath River Basin, showing sampling sites, major tributaries, the study area, and the former Iron Gate Dam. B) Cross section sampling design for collection of water samples. Where bi is the distance to shore to the center of the sampling vertical (gridded rectangles), di is the depth of the sampling vertical, black stars are surface sample locations, and gray stars are depth sample locations. C) Sounding instruments, and cataraft mounted crane and winch for the deployment of dual US DH-59 isokinetic samplers. D) US DH-59 isokinetic sampler and sample jar used for collection of samples at depth.

Figure 2: Violin plots of eDNA concentration (copies per liter) by site for C. shasta (top), O. tshawytscha (bottom). White dots are the median and bars are the interquartile range.

Figure 3: Frequency distribution of depth (m), distance to shore (m), distance to thalweg (m), water velocity (m/s), and sampler-type (column 1), plots of C. shasta eDNA concentration versus depth, distance to shore, distance to thalweg, velocity, and sample-type (column 2), and O. tshawytscha eDNA concentration (column 3). Locally estimated scatterplot smoothers (LOESS) applied to data make no assumptions about underlying structure.

Figure 4: Environmental DNA concentrations for C. shasta (left), and for O. tshawytscha (right) at the six cross sections. eDNA concentrations (points) are scaled by site and species to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Points are scaled measured eDNA concentrations. The thick black line is the measured river bottom.

Figure 5: Level of precision for the estimation of the mean concentration of eDNA on six river cross sections for theoretical sampling efforts (the number of 1-liter samples collected), following n = (𝜎 / (COV x mean))2. Variability for C. shasta (top), and for O. tshawytscha (bottom) from observed data at each site.

Figure 6: A) Fitted versus observed C. shasta eDNA concentrations (thousands of copies per L) with 1:1 line. B) Fitted versus observed O. tshawytscha eDNA concentrations (natural log of copies per L) with 1:1 line. C) The multiplicative effect of scaled depth (mean of zero, standard deviation of 1) on O. tshawytscha eDNA concentration. D) The multiplicative effect of scaled distance to shore (mean of zero, standard deviation of 1) on O. tshawytscha eDNA concentration. 

Figure 7: The proposed general case following n = (𝜎 / (COV x mean))2. Where the necessary cross section sample size (n) is a function of the standard deviation from the mean eDNA concentration (𝜎) and the desired level of precision (COV). Three COV values depicted represent suitable values for research (0.1), management (0.2), or preliminary/pilot research (0.3).
