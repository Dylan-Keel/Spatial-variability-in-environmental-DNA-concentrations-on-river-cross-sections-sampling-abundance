# Project-Abstract
High variance across repeated measurements of environmental DNA (eDNA) concentrations may be partially responsible for the mixed efficacy of eDNA concentration as a proxy for aquatic organism abundance or biomass in streams. While environmental factors such as temperature and stream discharge are commonly used to explain variability in eDNA concentrations, few studies have assessed variability of eDNA concentration across river cross sections and rarely do eDNA studies incorporate spatially stratified sampling to account for variability within a site. We used droplet digital PCR to measure the concentration of extra-organismal eDNA from Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and the organismal eDNA from their abundant and pathogenic myxozoan parasite, Ceratonova shasta, in water samples collected from six cross sections of a river (basin area ≅ 40,000 km2). Concentrations of eDNA were heterogeneously distributed on river cross sections varying from non-detectable levels to 257,222 copies per liter. Within cross sections the coefficient of variation (COV) of eDNA concentration spanned from 0.40 to 1.43. We found that to estimate the mean eDNA concentration at a river cross section with a level of statistical power (COV = 0.2), the number of spatially stratified water samples varied by species and cross section. For C. shasta, an average of 15 one-liter samples were necessary, while O. tshawytscha required an average of 11 one-liter samples. A generalized linear mixed effected model fit to the C. shasta data did not explain a meaningful amount of variability in eDNA concentration, but the model fit to the O. tshawytscha data identified a pattern where eDNA concentrations decreased with sample depth.
